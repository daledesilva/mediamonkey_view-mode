# View Mode
A MediaMonkey script that simplifies the library selection menu.

---

Do you use a bunch of different nodes commonly that you always have to switch to a particular view mode for?
Maybe you want the Track Browser open when you click on your artist node, but not when you click on other nodes. With this script, you can set up specific view settings for different nodes.

The new view modes in MediaMonkey 3 are great. They let your browse your collection in a few different ways that work best for different tasks. However, quite often the browsing method and view mode are specific to particular nodes you use, and every time you click on those nodes, you have to manually select the view mode or Track Browser visibility.

View Mode adds 2 branches to the right click menu when you click on compatible nodes. Simply choose one of the 3 view modes (Details, Album Art, Album Art & Details) and the node will remember those settings. The second branch allows you to choose between a visible Track Browser or a hidden one. Next time you click on the node, these view settings will automatically be applied for you.

If you want View Mode to forget specific settings for a node, choose "Clear Default" from that nodes right click menu.
